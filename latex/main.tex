% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
% \ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%   % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
%   % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
%   \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
% \else
%   % normal IEEE
%   \usepackage{cite}
% \fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.


\usepackage{enumitem} 



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{./resources/}}
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment for describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx








% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***
% *** TITLE/SUBJECT/AUTHOR/KEYWORDS INFO BELOW!!           ***
\newcommand\MYhyperrefoptions{
    bookmarks=true,

%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref



\usepackage{minted}
% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )
